    <h1>What My Grandmother Can Teach Us About Integration</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Not to be rude, but grandparents are weird.</p>
    <p1>They endured harsh challenges with respect to war, poverty, or human rights abuse. Yet they bought their house for like only $50. Despite their uncannyness, I believe grandparents are just as important as youth. While one determines the future, the other determines what knowledge is passed on to the future, like my grandmother. Though she was born a third generation immigrant, she later became a first generation one. Her life story can teach us a valuable lesson about how we misunderstand the idea of integration in the 21st-century.</p>
